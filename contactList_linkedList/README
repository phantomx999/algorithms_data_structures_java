ContactList using LinkedList implementation

Contains contact list info of people.  List of people info is stored as nodes in linked list.

Uses different functions to add, remove, sort, etc. to modify nodes in list.

Also reads from a text file a person's info and adds it as node 
to the current contact info linked list


Finally, can write all contact nodes of linked list to a text file


List of functions:
add()
find()
remove()
write()
read()
getCurrent()
get()
next()
previous()
sort()

Has a time complexity analysis of contact list functions 


DESIGN:
-Contact class that contains person's information data

-ContactNode class that contains node of person's info that is part of linked list

-ContactLinkedList that contains the linked list and application (main)

To RUN:

javac (compile) all necessary classes first that are not main application

>javac ContactLinkedList.java

>java ContactLinkedList
