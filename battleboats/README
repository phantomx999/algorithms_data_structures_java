BattlebBoats Game in Java

Objective:
Game is similar to battleship the board game, object is to sink all of the ships on 
a "m x n" grid represented by 2D array (m and n can be any numbers from 3 to 12, inclusively).


Rules and Set up:

Enter 0 for debug mode, or 1 for regular mode 
Debug shows where boats are, regular mode makes boats hidden.

Next, enter m and n size board
After user inputs board size via m and n dimensions UI, user can place "rocks" on board.

Rocks prevent ships from being placed on same location as rock.  Rocks also draw a penalty
of adding extra turn if user hits a rock location.

Number of rocks can be 0 up to Min(m, n) - 2 rocks

Enter "13" to be done placing rocks or continue to place rocks on board unti Min(m, n) - 2
number of rocks is reached.

Boats are then randomly placed on board based on random number generator

Number of boats placed:
Smallest Dimension 						Boat Quantity
Width == 3 or height == 3 							1
3 < width <= 5 or 3 < height <= 5 					2
5 < width <= 7 or 5 < height <= 7 					3
7 < width <= 9 or 7 < height <= 9 					4
9 < width <= 12 or 9 < height <= 12 				6

All boats are length 3 and are horizontal or vertical on board

Example of 4 x 4 board below (debug mode):

There are 2 boat(s) total on the board.

Turn: 1		 Shots fired: 0		 Boats Remaining: 2
DEBUG DISPLAY BOARD
| 1 1 1 0  |    0
| R 0 0 2  |    1
| 0 0 0 2  |    2
| 0 0 0 2  |    3
--------------------------
  0 1 2 3 
     column  

0 = ???    R = Rock   1 - 6 = Boats    M = Missed shot    X = hit!   S = Sunk

Choose the column index to fire shot

A shot that is out of bounds such as (-1, 2) or (3, 5) is a penalty and cost an extra turn

Ships are numbered 1 to 6 total (in this example, 1 to 2).

If a ship gets hit, it displays an X on board

If a ship is sunk, it displays S for sunk

Shots fired keeps track of all fired shots by user

Game ends when all ships are sunk



DESIGN:

-BattleboatsBoard class that keeps track of the board played on

-Boat class that keeps track of boat attributes

-Game class that contains the game application (main) to be run..


To Run:

javac (compile) all necessary classes first that are not main application

> javac Game.java

> java Game
