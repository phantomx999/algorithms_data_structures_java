1.  Random number generator java class "Random" using this equation to get random number:

rnew = ((P1 â‡¤ rold) + P2) mod M

where M, P1, and P2 are large, constant prime numbers

and random numbers generated are greater than or equal to 0 and less than M

rold = seed value and is calculated using previous random number generated

seed is hardcoded but could be produced using System.currentTimeMillis() as well


2.  Determines if a number is prime number (true or false) as well as MersennePrime where

	MerseneePrime = 2^k - 1 for some integer k.
	
	Other prime number functions included such as returning an array of the first n number
	
	of primes, finding the nth prime number, and finding the prime factorization of numbers.
	
Design:

-Random.java class
 
-Prime.java  class

-Application.java


To Run in terminal:

javac (compile) all necessary classes first that are not main application

> javac Application.java

> java Application
